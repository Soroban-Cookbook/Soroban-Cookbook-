# Advanced Examples

Complex smart contract patterns and architectural designs for experienced developers.

## Examples

### Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern** - Dynamic contract deployment
- **Registry Pattern** - Service discovery and contract registration
- **Diamond Pattern** - Modular contract architecture
- **Beacon Proxy** - Minimal proxy with upgradeable implementation

### Cross-Chain

- **Bridge Contract** - Asset bridging between chains
- **Cross-Chain Messaging** - Message passing protocols
- **Wrapped Assets** - Chain-specific asset wrapping

### Complex Financial

- **Bonding Curves** - Automated price discovery
- **Dutch Auction** - Descending price auctions
- **Vesting Schedule** - Token vesting with cliffs and periods
- **Options Protocol** - Put/call options implementation

### Optimization Patterns

- **Gas Optimization** - Minimize resource usage
- **Batch Operations** - Efficient bulk processing
- **Lazy Evaluation** - Deferred computation patterns
- **Merkle Proofs** - Efficient data verification

## 🎯 Prerequisites

Before exploring advanced examples, ensure mastery of:

- [Basic Examples](../basics/) - Core concepts
- [Intermediate Examples](../intermediate/) - Common patterns
- Rust advanced features (traits, generics, lifetimes)
- Smart contract security principles

## 🧠 Advanced Concepts

### State Management

- Efficient storage layout
- Gas-optimized data structures
- Archive and restoration patterns

### Security Patterns

- Time-delayed execution
- Circuit breakers
- Rate limiting
- Emergency stops

### Scalability

- Off-chain computation
- State channels
- Batch processing
- Minimal on-chain footprint

## ⚠️ Important Notes

These examples demonstrate advanced techniques that:

- May have complex security implications
- Require thorough testing and auditing
- Should be used with full understanding
- May need customization for production use

## 🔒 Security First

Advanced patterns increase attack surface:

1. **Audit Everything** - Professional security review required
2. **Test Extensively** - Unit, integration, and fuzz testing
3. **Monitor Closely** - Real-time monitoring in production
4. **Have Response Plans** - Incident response procedures
5. **Document Thoroughly** - Explain design decisions

## 📚 Learning Approach

1. **Study Each Pattern** - Understand the problem it solves
2. **Review Trade-offs** - Every pattern has costs and benefits
3. **Implement Incrementally** - Start simple, add complexity
4. **Test Rigorously** - Break your own code
5. **Seek Review** - Multiple eyes catch more issues
