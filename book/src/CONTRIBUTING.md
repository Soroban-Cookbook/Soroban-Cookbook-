## ✅ Checklist for New Examples

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] Code is formatted with `cargo fmt`
- [ ] README.md included with usage instructions
- [ ] Inline comments explain key concepts
- [ ] Contract includes proper error handling
- [ ] Example is placed in the correct category
- [ ] Main README.md is updated

## 🎨 Code Style

Follow standard Rust conventions:

```rust
// Good: Clear naming, proper documentation
/// Transfers tokens from one account to another.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `from` - Source account address
/// * `to` - Destination account address
/// * `amount` - Number of tokens to transfer
///
/// # Panics
/// Panics if the sender has insufficient balance.
pub fn transfer(env: Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    from.require_auth();
    // Implementation...
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

Test individual functions in isolation:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_transfer() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, MyContract);
    // Test logic...
}
```

### Integration Tests

Test complete workflows:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_complete_workflow() {
    // Set up multiple contracts
    // Execute a full user journey
    // Verify end state
}
```
