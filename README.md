## 📖 About

The Soroban Cookbook is a developer's guide to building smart contracts on the Stellar network using Soroban. This repository provides clear, well-documented examples and practical patterns for developers at every level—from your first "Hello World" contract to complex DeFi protocols.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

### 📚 Examples by Difficulty

- **[Basics](./examples/basics/)** - Core concepts: storage, auth, events, and data types
- **[Intermediate](./examples/intermediate/)** - Tokens, NFTs, multi-contract interactions
- **[Advanced](./examples/advanced/)** - DeFi protocols, governance systems, cross-chain patterns

### 🏗️ Examples by Use Case

- **[DeFi](./examples/defi/)** - AMMs, lending, vaults, escrow, and yield protocols
- **[NFTs](./examples/nfts/)** - Minting, marketplaces, and metadata standards
- **[Governance](./examples/governance/)** - DAOs, voting systems, and proposals
- **[Tokens](./examples/tokens/)** - Custom tokens, wrappers, and token standards

### 📝 Comprehensive Guides

- **[Getting Started](./guides/getting-started.md)** - Set up your development environment
- **[Your First Contract](./guides/first-contract.md)** - Write, test, and deploy
- **[Testing Guide](./guides/testing.md)** - Unit tests, integration tests, and best practices
- **[Deployment Guide](./guides/deployment.md)** - Deploy to testnet and mainnet
- **[Migrating from Ethereum](./guides/ethereum-to-soroban.md)** - Solidity → Rust patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Soroban-Cookbook/Soroban-Cookbook-.git
cd Soroban-Cookbook

# Install Rust and Soroban CLI (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install --locked soroban-cli

# Try a basic example
cd examples/basics/01-hello-world
cargo test
soroban contract build

# Deploy to testnet
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_world.wasm \
  --network testnet
```
